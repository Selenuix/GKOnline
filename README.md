A brief story:
================

One day, a friend started to create her website
using [e-monsite](https://www.e-monsite.com/). As I would like to become a web developer later and as I also don't really like e-monsite or wix and others, I just asked her to do it. She wanted a basic website to put her drawings on.

The project started in December 2017, with some hand-sketched models. Then, I discovered the Laravel PHP framework. So, I just began to learn it and I thought that it could be a great idea to use Laravel for this project.

Project status:
===================
This project is abandoned, since it is not needed by my friend anymore.
